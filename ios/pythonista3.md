As of version 3.2 Pythonista 3 now supports iCloud sync. You can find your code in 
`~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~com~omz-software~Pythonista3/Documents`. 

Make it easier to find by creating a symlink in your main dev folder e.g. `ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/iCloud~com~omz-software~Pythonista3/Documents ~/dev/python/pythonista3`
