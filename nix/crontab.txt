# how to run a job on alternating weeks

# Scenario: You one to run a script on Wednesday at 4PM on alternating weeks

# crontab entry
0 16    * * 3 [ $(( `date +\%W` \%2 )) -eq 0 ] && your_script.sh

# let's explain what's happening in the test
#
# [ $((             <- shell arithmetic
#       `date +\%W` <- return the week number for the year 00..53
#   \%2 ))          <- modulo by 2
# -eq 0 ]           <- test if the result of the modulo operation had a 
#                      remainder

# let's evaluate this this test
#
# [ $(( 04 \%2 )) -eq 0 ] # we get 04 if today was 24th of January 2018 16:00
# [ $(( 0      )) -eq 0 ] # modulo by 2 gets us 0
# [ 0             -eq 0 ] # our test will return true, and trigger the payload

# If you want to on 31st of January you just need to change the test to 1,
# this is because we'll get week number 5.

# crontab entry (for week numbers that will a remainder if divided by 2)
0 16    * * 3 [ $(( `date +\%W` \%2 )) -eq 1 ] && your_script.sh

# - Talk about how much of a PITA cron is command substitution only works in
